Developing Data Products - Course Project
=======================================
This is a submission for Coursera: Developing Data Products- Course Project

Storm Data Explorer
=======================================

This application is based on the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database.

Dataset has been obtained from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2) and processed for the course project. This is the same file that was used earlier for the Cousera's Reproduciable Research Course.

Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for various states and communities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

Preventing such outcomes or planning around the weather related events can reduce the impacts from the events.

Source code for the project is available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/kamineny/DevelopingDataProducts-CourseProject).

The presentation for the project can be found [here](http://rpubs.com/kamineny/49447)

You can adjust date range and event types using control panel located on the left side.

The results are shown in the main pannel on the right sideof the page. Filtered dataset can be downloaded using data tab.
